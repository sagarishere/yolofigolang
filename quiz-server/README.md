# Kood Quiz development server

1. Start server by `go run .`
2. Go to [localhost:10000](http://localhost:10000)

How to use it:

To get list of all Answers, make GET request to [/all/](http://localhost:10000/all/)

To add an answer to system, make POST request to [/add/](http://localhost:10000/add/)

I recommend you to use Desktop version of [Postman](https://postman.com/) for making GET and POST requests.
