Let's first make a GoLang file to push some data to our MongoDB Atlas cluster. After that we will think about deployement.

I will use this readme file as a documentation also as most of the web resources I find on GoLang+MongoDB combination even at their official docs is outdated or deprecated.

==============================

for connecting to mongoDB Atlas cluster:
mongosh "mongodb+srv://cluster0.wghwm.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase" --username THISISUSERNAME
